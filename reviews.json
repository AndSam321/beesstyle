The quality and the taste is good, however, the portion wise it\u2019s on the lessar side. My noodles were fine for me. But the grilled chicken portion was really less, which was compensated with white rice! So overall it was a bit dry to eat. You can sit and eat at the benches, the ambience is cool.",
